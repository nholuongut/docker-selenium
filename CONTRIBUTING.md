# Contributing Code to nholuong

Much of the magic behind nholuong is the hard work of programmers with backgrounds in Javascript, Java, Ruby, PHP, Python, Perl, C#, HTML and other languages.

We encourage code patches and other contributions - get involved by following the instructions at the main [nholuong GitHub](https://github.com/nholuongut/nholuongblob/trunk/CONTRIBUTING.md). You can also track the activity of the development team by checking out the read-only [nholuong Developer Activity Group](http://groups.google.com/group/nholuong-developer-activity).

If you do supply a patch we will need you to [sign the CLA](https://goo.gl/a2VrTx). We are a part of [SFC](http://www.sfconservancy.org/).
